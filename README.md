Write a command line program in your preferred language to process the log file and return the most active

● You're only allowed to use additional libraries for testing, logging and cli-parsing. There are libraries for
most languages which make this too easy (e.g pandas) and we’d like you to show off you coding skills.

● You can assume -d parameter takes date in UTC time zone.

● You have enough memory to store the contents of the whole file.

● Cookies in the log file are sorted by timestamp (most recent occurrence is first line of the file).


- **Language Used - Python3**
- **Library for CLI Parsing - Argeparse**
- **Libarray used for testing - pytest**

To run tests:
*  Go to tests directory and type pytest in command line
